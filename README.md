### 3.3 Problem Specifications

Traditional computing environments, particularly in educational, professional, and resource-constrained contexts, face several persistent challenges that can undermine accessibility, efficiency, and security. Project X is designed to address these core issues by leveraging containerization and web technologies to create a more accessible and secure computing platform.

**Hardware Dependencies**:
Users with limited resources often cannot access specialized software or run resource-intensive applications due to hardware constraints. This creates inequitable access to computing capabilities, particularly affecting students, small businesses, and users in developing regions. Project X addresses this challenge through browser-based access to containerized applications, allowing even basic devices to run sophisticated software through the cloud.

**Environment Consistency**:
Organizations struggle to maintain consistent computing environments across different devices and locations, leading to compatibility issues, "works on my machine" problems, and inconsistent experiences. This is particularly problematic in educational settings and distributed teams. Project X solves this through containerization, ensuring that all users access identical software environments regardless of their local setup.

**Resource Utilization**:
Traditional computing environments often suffer from inefficient resource allocation, with machines either overprovisioned (wasting resources) or underprovisioned (creating performance bottlenecks). The session-based resource allocation in Project X ensures computing resources are efficiently distributed and only consumed when actively needed.

**Security Vulnerabilities**:
Local computing environments frequently lack enterprise-grade security measures, exposing sensitive data to risks including theft, loss, or hardware failures. By centralizing computing in secure containers and implementing robust authentication, Project X significantly enhances security posture compared to traditional setups.

2. **Payment Processing (server/controllers/paymentController.js)**:
```javascript
// Stripe payment integration
const createOrder = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { user_id, email } = req.body;
        
        // Create a Stripe session
        const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
            payment_method_types: ['card'],
            line_items: [{
                price_data: {
                    currency: 'usd',

                    },
                    unit_amount: 500, // $5.00
                },
                quantity: 1,
            }],
            mode: 'payment',
            success_url: `${process.env.FRONTEND_URL}/dashboard?success=true`,
            cancel_url: `${process.env.FRONTEND_URL}/dashboard?canceled=true`,
            customer_email: email,
            metadata: {

        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to create payment session' });
    }

```

3. **Container Management (docker/orchestration.js)**:
```javascript
// Docker container management
const createContainer = async (userId, applicationId) => {
    try {
        const docker = new Docker();
        
        // Create container with appropriate settings
        const container = await docker.createContainer({
            Image: `application-${applicationId}`,
            Env: [`USER_ID=${userId}`],
            HostConfig: {
                Memory: 512 * 1024 * 1024, // 512MB memory limit
                MemorySwap: 1024 * 1024 * 1024, // 1GB swap
                NanoCpus: 1 * 1000000000, // 1 CPU core
                NetworkMode: 'bridge'
            }
        });
        
        // Start the container
        await container.start();
        
        // Get container info
        const info = await container.inspect();
        
        return {
            containerId: info.Id,
            port: info.NetworkSettings.Ports['80/tcp'][0].HostPort
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Container creation failed:', error);
